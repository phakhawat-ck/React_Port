# React Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project, built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It's my very first experience working with both technologies — a great learning journey!

### ✨ Features:
- Built with React (Vite)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Fully responsive layout
- Custom components and clean UI design

### 💡 Developer Note:
This project marks my first time working with React and Tailwind CSS.  
While the code may not be perfect yet, I'm continuously learning and actively improving it.

I believe in learning-by-doing, and this project reflects my growth as a developer.  
Constructive feedback is always welcome!
